Tower Defense Game. This game was created in Unity using C#.

This game had multiple challenges:
-The way I had to create the shop was really interesting. I had to make sure the cursor wasn't over any character or another menu was not already open.
-Spawning the characters used ScriptableObjects to make sure the default values of the character were the same.
-Spawning the enemies had to be at a random point on the edge of the map, and the enemy had to be a random value. This I used ScriptableObjects to premake the enemy count of the waves, and then randomly pick an enemy, and spawn it at a random point.
